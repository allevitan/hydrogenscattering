What does the program need to do?

Simplest version:

Must accept:
* A grid of FCC and HCP densities
* A grid of laser fluence at w and 3w
* An offset between beam and jet (perhaps folded into the laser fluence)

Must return:
* Scattering intensity as a function of angle


Thoughts:
Maybe it needs some parameter for crystal size? Because it looks like each shot actually
