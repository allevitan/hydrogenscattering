##Hydrogen Jet Scattering

This is a simulation program designed to simulate the XRD spectra that result from the interacion of a short-pulse XFEL with a jet of solid Hydrogen. The ultimate goal is to use this code to piece together some information about the structure of the hydrogen jet during the scattering.
